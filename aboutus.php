                    <h2>Vineet Padia</h2>
                    <p class="lead"> Mechanical engineering student at the University of Maryland. In the summer of 2009, Vineet put a Makerbot Cupcake CNC together and got hooked into 3D printing. Since then, he has built a few RepRap printers and has designed various modifications for them. He has also worked extensively with FIRST where heâ€™s built numerous awesome robots. He hopes to bring mechanical design to the masses through innovative interface devices.</p>

                    <h2>Umesh Padia</h2>
                    <p class="lead"> Umesh Padia is currently a senior at Poolesville High School in the Science Math and Computer Science Program, a program that has encouraged him to enhance his problem solving skills and research ability. Thereafter, Umesh has competed in several competitions in computer science including the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) Challenge, which allowed him to pioneer new investigative tools to solve a series of challenges.  Umesh took on an internship at the National Institutes of Health where he worked in the fields of endocrinology and computational biology to discover the first bioavailable agonist for the TRH Receptor. In both his education and career, he seeks to apply engineering and computer science to fields that have societal impact. </p>
